        <h1><u>ABOUT</u> <u> ME!</u></h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio and blog site! My name is K.Abithasri, and I am a computer science student in my prefinal year at Sathyabama College. I created this site to document and share my exciting journey of exploring computer science and its applications in a fun way.</p>
<p>I am passionate about AI and ML, as well as web development. I have completed two internships at HCL and Business Web Solutions, where I learned a lot and gained valuable experience. I am currently looking for my third internship, so if you have any opportunities for me, please let me know! ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>I am also a digital artist and I love art, creativity, and innovation. Besides computer science, I have a major interest in psychology and astronomy, which inspired me to choose a space theme for my site. ðŸš€</p>
<p>On this site, you can see the projects that I have worked on, as well as the projects and challenges that I am going to work on. You can also follow my journey of learning AI and ML in just two weeks! I will keep the site updated every day, so you can see my progress and maybe join me too!</p>

    <p class="card-desc">"Proudly Pride" is a vibrant website born out of a desire to infuse life with joy and unity. It features a delightful 
      unicorn game where players collect pride flags across three engaging levels. The Rainbowchat connects users within the same community, 
      fostering idea-sharing and fun interactions. A unique random flag generator raises awareness about diverse community flags, emphasizing
       their significance. Built with HTML, CSS, Firebase, and React, the site showcases a sleek starting page and dynamic chat functionality. 
       Challenges, including mastering CSS layout and navigating new technologies like Firebase and API integration, were overcome in the pursuit 
       of creating a functional and enjoyable platform. The project marks a journey of learning, from manipulating API data to crafting soothing 
       CSS animations. Looking ahead, "Proudly Pride" aims to expand with detailed flag descriptions, more games, events, and community moderation 
       features. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/proudly-pride">check here</a></p>

    <h2 class="card-title">Agri-E</h2>
    <img src="images/Agri-E.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="card-desc"><b>My first ever hackathon project!</b><br>I won an appreciation for this project in the hackathon competition, I developed a small E-market website catering to agricultural products. This platform is designed to
      serve both customers and sellers, with a primary focus on providing optimal products to farmers who may have limited knowledge about specific items. Sellers also benefit by offering discounts and advertisements directly on the website.

      Key features of the website include:<br>
      
      1. Chat Bot: A user-friendly chat bot is implemented to assist and guide users, addressing their queries and providing valuable
       information.<br>
      
      2. Quality/Quantity Display: The website ensures transparency by displaying information about product quality and quantity according to 
      government regulations. This empowers farmers to make informed decisions.<br>
      
      3. Advertisements: Sellers can promote their products through advertisements on the website, increasing visibility and attracting 
      potential customers.<br>
      
      4. Average Pricing: The platform provides average pricing information, giving users a benchmark for fair market values.<br>
      
      This project is a simple static website developed specifically for the hackathon, aiming to address the needs of both farmers and sellers in the agricultural market.

    <p class="card-desc">Inspired by the stress-relieving power of memes, my project is designed to not only help you create memes but 
      
      also display them, igniting your passion for humorous content.<br>

      Built using Velo by Wix, along with HTML, CSS, and JS for code embedding, the platform tackles the challenge of making meme creation and
       enjoyment accessible to all. Despite encountering backend issues along the way, I triumphantly overcame them, showcasing my ability to 
       create engaging widgets through Velo by Wix.<br>
      
      Throughout the development process, I learned valuable lessons, particularly in the realm of displaying analytical information from 
      datasetsâ€”an area I aim to further explore and refine. The project, crafted with HTML, CSS, JS, and Velo, earned recognition by winning a 
      hackathon competition hosted by MLH, marking a proud accomplishment in my journey of meme-inspired innovation. <a href="https://abithasreekolli.wixsite.com/memelet?siteRevision=69">try out my site here!</a></p>

    <img src="images/Nakshatra.png" alt="">
    <p class="card-desc">Nakshatra, an astronomy club website developed during my HCL internship, serves as an interactive platform connecting astronomy enthusiasts in a dedicated community. The application encompasses various features to engage and educate its members:
      <br><br>
      1. <b>Astronomy Community Hub:</b> A virtual meeting place for users, fostering connections and discussions among astronomy enthusiasts.
      <br>
      2. <b>Real-Time Space Weather Alerts:</b> Utilizing NASA's DONKI API, the website provides timely updates on space weather conditions, keeping members informed.
      <br>
      3. <b>Space Picture of the Day:</b> A daily snapshot of space, fetched through API calls (APOD), serves as a learning tool for members.
      <br>
      4. <b>Login/Membership Portal:</b> Users can register accounts with password security using MD5 hashing.
      <br>
      5. <b>Space Quiz:</b> An entertaining and challenging feature created with the Scratch tool.
      <br>
      6. <b>Asteroid Exploration:</b> Users can find asteroids close to Earth, accessing detailed information through the NeoWs API.
      <br>
      7. <b>Host Events:</b> The website facilitates event scheduling and displays upcoming events using PHPMyAdmin and a local database.
      <br><br>
      <b>Future Scope of the Project:</b>
      Looking forward, Nakshatra aims to evolve into a collaborative hub for idea generation within the astronomy community. 
      Additionally, plans include implementing an online book borrowing system focused on astronomy, enhancing members' knowledge through 
      accessible literature. These initiatives underscore our commitment to knowledge dissemination and continuous enrichment within the
       astronomy club.<br><a href="https://github.com/Abithasree/nakshatra">Check here for source code and details</a></p>
